/* RTL Support Styles */

/* Since we use <html dir="rtl">, we don't need manual layout hacks.
   We only need to ensure the font looks good in Arabic.

.rtl {
  font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;

.rtl input,
.rtl textarea,
.rtl select {
  text-align: right;

/* Optional: Fix specific directional icons if they don't flip automatically.
   Most FontAwesome icons don't need flipping, but directional arrows might.
   Only add specific overrides here if you notice a specific icon pointing the wrong way.
